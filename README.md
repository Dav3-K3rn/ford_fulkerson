## Algorithms Implemented
- Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm is used to compute maximum flow in a flow network.


## Programming Languages and Paradigms
- Python (Procedural)
- C++ (Object-Oriented)


## Compilers/Interpreters Used
- Python: CPython (Python 3.x)
- C++: g++ or Visual Studio


## Instructions for Running and Testing Code
1. **Python:**
   - Ensure Python is installed.
   - Run the script: `python ford_fulkerson.py`


2. **C++:**
   - Compile the code: `g++ ford_fulkerson.cpp -o ford_fulkerson`
   - Run the executable: `./ford_fulkerson`


Description of Differences


Programming Paradigms:
* Python (Procedural):
   * Use data structures and functions to control behavior and state. 
   * The implementation is simple and emphasizes methodical execution. 
   * Less focus on data hiding and encapsulation.
* C++ (Object-Oriented):
   * Contains functions and data in classes. 
   * Uses polymorphism and class inheritance to encourage modularity and reusability. 
   * Although its syntax is more complicated, it offers superior abstraction and data management.


Compilers/Interpreters:
* Python: Uses an interpreter (e.g., CPython).
* C++: Requires a compiler (e.g., g++ or Visual Studio).


Conclusion:
* Garbage Collection: Python automates memory management, while C++ gives programmers control, requiring careful handling.
* Implementation Model: Python’s interpreted nature allows for quick iterations, whereas C++ provides high performance through compilation.
* Typing System: Python’s dynamic typing offers flexibility at the cost of potential runtime errors, while C++'s static typing enhances safety and performance.
